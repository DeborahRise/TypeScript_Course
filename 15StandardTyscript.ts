// Create a file called "types.ts" - this will contain all the different types definition for a project. so define all your interfaces and class and so on

// And the code gets bigger, we may need to break into multiple files, based on where they are gonna be used. eg. in src/components/types.ts for all types defined in the the components.

// Note that src can also have its own types.ts file that has shares types for all directories under it
